### Hi, my name is Jae ðŸ‘‹

I am a full stack web developer. I currently reside in Minnesota, where I have lived since moving from Seoul, South Korea in 1997. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Carleton College (Northfield, MN) in 2015, and I completed the University of Minnesota Full Stack Flex Full-Time Coding Bootcamp in 2022.
