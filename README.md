### Hi, my name is Jae ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring full stack web developer. I am currently enrolled in the University of Minnesota Full Stack Flex Online Full-Time Coding Bootcamp. I currently reside in Minnesota, where I have lived since moving from Seoul, South Korea in 1997. I earned a Bachelor of Science degree in Biology from Carleton College (Northfield, MN) in 2015. My previous work experiences have been in fields such as academic research, pharmacy, law, and retail management. Upon completion of my current coding bootcamp program, I hope to add web development to that list.
